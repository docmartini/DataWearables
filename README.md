Wearables Data
==============

Data sets 
---------

Two data sets are included. The first **observations.txt**, includes mean and standard deviation values for all observations
of both training and test data as well as subject and activity. Including activity and subject columns, this data set contains 68 columns. 
The second, **summary.txt** includes average values for each variable with respect to subject and activity. This also contains 68 variables.

Selected variables are detailed below.
